# NLP_experiments
Experiments related to Natural Language Processing aimed at gaining a  better understanding of text preprocessing and classification

MakeYourOwn_TFIDVectorizer.ipynb creates a homemade version of SKLearn's TDFID Vectorizer and experiments with different methods of pre-preprocessing to improve performance

LabellingAnalysis_Word2Vec.ipynb investigates whether information from unlabelled data can be used to improve performance

CrossTrainingEvaluation_Classification.ipynb investigates the challenge to applying a word model trained on a certain corpus to a different data set

MixtureModel_LDA.ipynb investigates the different word distributions between 2 classes of model generated through a mixture model and LDA methods
