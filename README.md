# NLP_experiments
Short experiments related to Natural Language Processing aimed at gaining a  better understanding of text preprocessing and classification

**Structure of this repo**

- [MakeYourOwn_TFIDVectorizer.ipynb](https://github.com/c-maine/NLP_experiments/blob/master/MakeYourOwn_TFIDVectorizer.ipynb) creates a homemade version of SKLearn's TDFID Vectorizer and experiments with different methods of pre-preprocessing to improve performance

- [LabellingAnalysis_Word2Vec.ipynb](https://github.com/c-maine/NLP_experiments/blob/master/LabellingAnalysis_Word2Vec.ipynb) investigates whether information from unlabelled data can be used to improve performance

- [CrossTrainingEvaluation_Classification.ipynb](https://github.com/c-maine/NLP_experiments/blob/master/CrosstrainingEvaluation_Classification.ipynb) investigates the challenge to applying a word model trained on a certain corpus to a different data set

- [MixtureModel_LDA.ipynb](https://github.com/c-maine/NLP_experiments/blob/master/MixtureModel_LDA.ipynb) investigates the different word distributions between 2 classes of model generated through a mixture model and LDA methods

- [SVMClassifier_TerrorTourism.ipynb](https://github.com/c-maine/NLP_experiments/blob/master/SVMClassifier_TerrorTourism.ipynb) implements an SVM Classifier on a Terror- Tourism dataset

**Example graph**

Below is an example graph from the [MakeYourOwn_TFIDVectorizer notebook](https://github.com/c-maine/NLP_experiments/blob/master/MakeYourOwn_TFIDVectorizer.ipynb), which shows the pairwise distances between documents, a useful feature for search.
