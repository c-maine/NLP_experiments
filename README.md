# NLP_experiments
Short experiments related to Natural Language Processing aimed at gaining a  better understanding of text preprocessing and classification

1. [MakeYourOwn_TFIDVectorizer.ipynb](https://github.com/c-maine/NLP_experiments/blob/master/MakeYourOwn_TFIDVectorizer.ipynb) creates a homemade version of SKLearn's TDFID Vectorizer and experiments with different methods of pre-preprocessing to improve performance

2. [LabellingAnalysis_Word2Vec.ipynb](https://github.com/c-maine/NLP_experiments/blob/master/LabellingAnalysis_Word2Vec.ipynb) investigates whether information from unlabelled data can be used to improve performance

3. [CrossTrainingEvaluation_Classification.ipynb](https://github.com/c-maine/NLP_experiments/blob/master/CrosstrainingEvaluation_Classification.ipynb) investigates the challenge to applying a word model trained on a certain corpus to a different data set

4. [MixtureModel_LDA.ipynb](https://github.com/c-maine/NLP_experiments/blob/master/MixtureModel_LDA.ipynb) investigates the different word distributions between 2 classes of model generated through a mixture model and LDA methods

5. [SVMClassifier_TerrorTourism.ipynb](https://github.com/c-maine/NLP_experiments/blob/master/SVMClassifier_TerrorTourism.ipynb) implements an SVM Classifier on a Terror- Tourism dataset
