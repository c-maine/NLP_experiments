       " \"This buffet is so underrated in my opinion. Someone in our group recommended this place and I was super surprised at how good it was! I've been to almost every buffet in vegas like wicked spoon at cosmo, bacchanal at ceasars, the buffet at the wynn, etc...and this one was as good if not better than the others! (yes I'm a fatty and proud of it).\\n\\nService: Doesn't really matter at a buffet because you serve yourself. In my opinion, my service was excellent, so no complaints. Got up and got food real quick. BUT if you want to be nitpicky, it did take a little while to get seated when the line was short, then it again our group was 18 deep so understandable.\\n\\nFood: SO MUCH FOOD. The food wrapped around the whole room and it seemed to be endless. So many different food stations. As with all buffets, there was a crab leg section but no lame shortages here, it always seemed to be full of crab legs and no super long lines for it. When I do buffets I like to take a small bite out of every dish, and even doing this I couldn't eat everything I wanted because there was just too much food. Everything tastes fresh and delicious too. And finally there was FREE beer and wine. Not just cheap beer either, it was a house IPA, Heineken, and some other beer that I can't remember; probably because i had too many IPAs and Heinekens. \\n\\nPlace: Upscale, clean, and tons of space. Plenty of room around you to eat and not feel like anyone near you is judging you.\\n\\nOne of the best buffets in vegas in my opinion. PROTIP: Do buffet for lunch instead of dinner so you don't feel terrible about yourself on those vegas nights.\",\n",

My beef filet, priced by the ounce but only had one size available on Saturday night, wasn't even a filet but instead a cut of meat that looked like a sad sandwich steak (it was either skirt or hangar); it and its sides came cooked to the right temperature but devoid of salt. Did I mention that we waited 45 minutes for all this food to come? The waitress smartly did a drive-by question about how we liked it, never asking again after I asked for salt.

Then we got the answer.  My wife's eggs over medium were over cooked.  One egg yolk was solid, no run.  We asked for the eggs to be made again.  Once again the eggs came out in less then 2 minutes and they were the same, over cooked.  My wife asked for them to be taken away.  The bill came and there was no discount for the poorly cooked eggs.  When I noted this to the waitress, she said she thought the Manager had taken it off.  The Manager then came over and said she would take $2.50 off for the eggs my wife didn't like.  The waitress was then very surly and was tipped accordingly.

I needed a 'real' hat, I needed a professional hatter - I needed AZ-Tex. After arriving on-site I could tell I was in the right place: a large, comfortable great-room stuffed wall to wall with fine head gear. The sales person seemed to know I needed special care, as I was taken under her wing. We spent nearly an hour working though the store's many offerings, trying on and speaking about a wide verity of hats before I found the right one. It's made of leather with a screened top for ventilation (a must in the AZ summer) and it is easy on the eyes. So was the price. For the kicker, after a few days I was concerned that it may be a little too big. I arrived back at the store and there was another capable salesperson on the floor. She was just as kind and knowledgeable as the first. After much contemplation and re-measurements, I ended up having the hat replaced with a new one that was the next size down. It still wasn't a perfect fit and AZ-Tex respectfully demanded that I allow them to make it so. She took the hat into her shop in the back and after a few moments emerged with my hat, but it was professionally modified to be just a little smaller for a custom fit - like I said, I needed a hatter, not a kid selling franchised caps. As I left I was told that I can come back anytime and they will adjust the hat as needed. Come back I shall. Not so much because I think that this hat will need another adjustment, but because I saw another one there that also wants to live on my head. Who am I to deny its destiny...especially with such a fine business behind it.\",\n",

I made an appointment for both of my dogs to get check ups and to discuss one of my dogs who I was unsure if she was spayed or not. I adopted her and took her to a vet where I used to live and they told me she was spayed but then she went into heat. I wanted this bet to do an ultrasound before scheduling her to be spayed. The vet that did her check up was very rude and made me feel dumb for wanting the ultrasound. I insisted that we do the ultrasound before they cut her open and do exploratory surgery. I left her there for the ultrasound and when I came back to pick her up a completely different doctor came out to talk to me about the results. They said they were only about 90% sure she still had her uterus. I was confused on how they couldn't be sure and again this doctor made me feel stupid for asking questions. They said everything went smoothly so I took my dog home. The next day I noticed that her stomach had cuts all over it from them shaving her to do the ultrasound. No one said anything to me about it. I called them and told them about so they had me bring her back in. They gave me a cone to out around her head so she wouldn't lick it which was way too big babe has very short legs so her cone dragged on the ground and they have me a glorified bottle of Neosporin to put on it. I was very upset that they didn't tell me about it the day it happened. I'm sure they knew it had happened. Because they didn't I had to take additional time off work to bring her back. They were very expensive for the ultrasound and gave me a very high quote for a routine spay. Needless to say I will not be taking either of my dogs back there. I was very disappointed given the fact that they have so many 5 star reviews.\",\n",

I love good frybread so I was excited to see what this place had to offer.  I was sadly disappointed.\\n\\nI tried the Dev's chicken dish and my girlfriend tried another dish that I can't recall the name of.  I really can't believe that what came out was the standard that this place goes by.  The frybread itself wasn't bad but was pretty bland.  The rest of the stuff on top was even more bland than the frybread.  There were way too many refried beans on this thing and I think I got half of a head of lettuce on top of that.  I think there was chicken buried in there somewhere but it sure didn't taste like it.  There was absolutely no flavor to this thing which is impressive because the ingredients should have come together nicely (should have...but didn't).  I even tried to spice it up with the hot sauce they gave us and that had no flavor either.  My girlfriend didn't fare any better as her meal looked and tasted like a full can of refried beans and the other half of the head of lettuce that ended up on mine.\\n\\nShortly after we had begun eating some guy came out from the kitchen and asked if everything was ok.  The way he asked it though indicated that he was trying to see if he had made it correctly rather than simply seeing if we were enjoying the meal.  It was so awful that I simply didn't have the heart to tell the kid that it was some of the worst food I have ever had.\\n\\nPlease understand that I do not consider myself a food snob or anything like that.  This meal simply was poorly done and had zero taste to it.  I got through half of it and had to throw the rest away...and I hadn't eaten anything else all day so I was really hungry.  I also tried one of their house juice drinks that they had available.  The peach-melon sounded tasty.  It wasn't.  It tasted like drinking cantaloupe juice.\\n\\nIf you are a frybread company then you should at least do the frybread really well and then build on top of that.

From the warm, modern feel of the intimate dining room, to the soft glow cast on each perfectly coiffed dish by the low overhead lighting, it all adds up to the perfect setting for anything from a romantic dinner for two  to a formal meal with business colleagues. \\n\\nThe service is absolutely impeccable, the wine list a near-masterpiece, and the food superb. On a recent visit with friends, we started off with a succulent Foie Gras, along with a delicious Soft-shell Crab appetizer. Our server -- attentive to our every need -- recommended a superb Rhône wine, followed by a perfectly balanced French red blend for our entrees. \\n\\nFor dinner, I enjoyed a wonderful dish of Seared Scallops, while my wife dove into a plate of prime rib.

Oriental Phoenix (58 Ave) is the only place in Calgary I will eat Vietnamese food and I estimate I've dined there at least 40 times in the 15 years (#23 is my fave) with not one complaint ever.  We treated our friends to dinner out last night.  The food was embarassingly bad and the prices disturbingly high for the quality and quantity.  The server was very green (her first night) but she was adorable so we didn't want to make it difficult for her.  Tipped her well.  Don't get the calamari.  It is more like a plate of greasy onion rings with a few tidbits of calamari thrown in.  The combo is served on a large plate, not a bowl and looked nasty.  Not the usual fresh delight it is at Oriental Phoenix.  The imperial rolls were overcooked and had minimal filling.  My lemon grass chicken was just blah and dry.  It served with some jasmine rice and about a cup of mixed salad out of box.  $15?  So uninspired...waste of money and will never be back.\",\n",

We stayed for one night with our kids and as we were getting back to our room around 11 after running down to grab food for them we noticed an older gentleman sitting right outside of our door, he was a security guard. I didn't think anything of it at first, he was older and most likely tired from walking the halls of such a large place, but an hour later when I looked out of our door he was still there. I'm sure the kids were making some noise but not at a disruptive level. In the end he never knocked on our door to complain, he just sat there STARING at our door and scared the daylights out of my children. Sitting outside of people's doors for an hour and a half to try and intimidate them isn't the way to get people to quiet down, it's the way to get a terrible review. Needless to say..

We bought a small Yamaha jet boat last summer, and loved it.  Then we tried surfing on a friend\\'s boat, and decided to upgrade.  After considering the different options, we felt the Axis line of boats (built by Malibu) represented the best value for us - lots of wake, lots of room, great handling, great ergonomics, and best value for our money.\\n\\nWe began by talking with the General Manager, Mark.  He took a great deal of time to talk to us about what boat might fit our needs, what boats wouldn\\'t (and why), and how to get the most value for the best price.  He took the time to understand our family\\'s needs and abilities and our intentions about how the boat would get used most of the time (do you really think you\\'ll have 17 people on the boat with you?).  I\\'ve been in sales a long time, and Mark comes across as trusted advisor, more than guy trying to close a deal.\\n\\nHe introduced us to Dave Humphries (sales person) and Dave helped us consider the different options, and get out on the lake for a demo.  We ended up settling on the A24, but the A22 and T23 were in the mix, and probably would have been great choices as well.  He offered us a fair price on our trade in, and what we feel is a good price on the new boat.  \\n\\nHayden took us out for a demo, and helped us select some \"starter\" gear when we got back to the shop.  He was considerate in recommending low and mid-price gear for our mostly beginner family.  Again here, we didn\\'t feel \"oversold\" in an area where I\\'m sure their margins are good, and they could have pushed products that would have cost us more, and we might not have realized the benefit of.  Thank you, and well done.\\n\\nOur thanks to all the team at Boulder Boats.  We had a great experience at every interaction.  We felt that we, our time, and our business, were valued.

In a pinch, we took some friends to the MGM buffet, WITHOUT CHECKING YELP FIRST -- dumb dumb dumb dumb.\\n\\nI was embarrassed at what we found at the $27/person MGM Friday dinner buffet.  The \"sushi\" on offer consisted of one old-looking platter of krab-salad rolls and one platter of old-looking krab-california rolls.

(these legs were fine).\\n\\nOne entire row (of 4) consisted of salad and fruit (yay for healthy choices, but this can all be obtained from a grocery store and was clearly offered as a \"space filler\").  \\n\\nI walked in HUNGRY but the buffet was so visually unappealing that I only half-filled a plate with this and that and was disappointed to find the taste matched the lackluster appearance of each offering.  I\\'m sure the fruit was great, but that\\'s more of a snack item for me.\\n\\nAfter 3 unsuccessful sorties of trying this and that (potato halves with little pasta balls, a fish dish, a beef rib with over-salty gravy, some rock hard rolls, noodles) (none recommended), I resorted to eating some old-looking (and old-tasting) potstickers and some nasty orange-glazed chicken.  My request of the server for some chili sauce?  Denied: \"we only have the 4 sauces you see on your table.\"  (had to catch her in the bussing station to bother her with this request since she was generally not seen during our visit)\\n\\nOh, and while we\\'re on service, it matched the overall experience.  Perhaps we just got a bad attendant, but really, her only job is to keep drinks full and plates cleared.  No-Can-Do & No-Can-Do.\\n\\nMy low opinion of the food was verified by my buddy.  Though he politely pretended the food was fine, I could see that he was not finishing many of the items he chose for his plate.  This coming from a guy who is known to eat PLAIN, COLD, PASTA for lunch.

It was tiny, little pieces of ice cream, and it was unusually yummy!  I devoured much of it before tapping out.  Afterwards, I realized I was supposed to stir it all up (ice cream, fruit, and sauces), as it would have given the vanilla shavings more flavour.  I\\'d never been there before - so I had no idea!

We walked in, 2 gentelman working. We stood in the \"lobby\" for a few minutes and decided to seat ourselves. I noticed a family of 4 eating but no one else in the building. After 5 more minutes, watching one of the servers come in and deliver appetizers to said family, I grabbed menus for my friend and myself. I read said menu and decided on the wonderful sounding corned beef sandwich on rye, just like grandma used to make em. 10 minutes go by, said server delivers entrees and drinks to said family of 4. But not once does he look in our direction. Not once. So after a few more minutes we decide to leave, no service, you\\'d do the same, right? As we are walking through their store to get to parking lot in the rear, one of the gentelman says, \"Thanks guys.\". REALLY???  What do you think we did to recieve such service?

I have told several friends, (and strangers for that matter) about my expierence there and have heard similar stories from a few of them.

We went during the day, and sushi diners are placed on the \"upper level\" (the restaurant is divided into a higher and lower ledge) and those there for the Korean food are on the ground floor. While the food is okay, we will not be back due to the horrible service and treatment of the servers.\\n\\nWe went in on a Sunday afternoon.To preface, both ourselves, the menu, and our waitress were Korean. We got served with a dirty plate, and it was obvious that our waitress did not want to be there. We ordered a spicy shrimp dish, black bean noodles, and a spicy noodle dish. Now, she did not write our order down and we were promptly served with a sesame chicken dish instead. When we lamented that this was definitely not what we ordered (as we dislike sesame oil), she literally stood there silently and we chalked it up the fact that the dish differed in name only by one word and there must have been miscommunication (due to the fact that she was just standing there looking down at the floor; it was just awkward and I assumed maybe it was a company policy that they wouldn\\'t take back the food). We did not touch the dish.\\n\\nNow, it could have been fine after this. However, she delivered the black bean noodles and she was not seen again. Almost 15 minutes passed and I was basically done with my food. My mother and I assumed that she forgot to order her food, and looked for her to tell her it was fine and that we just wanted the check so we could leave. However, she stops by then to drop off her food and leaves immediately without checking in on us. By this time, both of our waters are empty. \\n\\nMy mom picks at her food for a bit when the waiter from our sushi section asks if everything is okay. Now, by this time, there is a full untouched plate of chicken, an empty noodle bowl, a half touched spicy noodle dish, and empty waters. He acknowledged and apologized for the service we received (although we were not his table) and we just asked for our check from him, as our server was still nowhere to be found. Although he managed to give us a 10% discount, we did not see our server or the manager stop by our table. We left, hungry and thirsty.\\n\\nDo not come here.

Very experienced. \\nI love linguini with clams/white sauce, I've had it many times at many great restaurants over the years, so I tried theirs. It was delicious and I was surprised from the bite of the crushed red peppers; if you don't like a little heat, order without, it will taste superb either way. There must have been at least 12 clams surrounding the linguini. Perfect sauce; just enough clam juice, white wine, butter, etc. Didn't taste any garlic. \\nMy daughters split the lasagna. These are ALL homemade dishes and it's a family restaurant. The atmosphere was pleasant. They have a decent wine list, though I didn't order off of it. We took 1/2 the lasagna home for Daddy and he loved it, too. The lasagna is slightly sweet, and the layers of pasta, meat and sauce are terrific. I am picky and I was impressed with this place. We will be back soon. Thanks.\",\n",
       " 'The worst experience I have every had at hooters!!! The worst I tell you. Do not go here. We will be writing a letter to corporate about how shitty the experience was and how shitty the manager was. We waited 45mins to get WATER. We had to ask another waitress because ours was MIA for the longest if we could get some drinks. We asked for the manager to tell him about our experience and he looked lost in the face and apologized. Ok cool, so we see that people that got seated after us not only got their drinks way before us but also their food. And another couple who came in right when we did ate and left while we are still waiting. It is now over an hour and we still do not have food. Our waitress came over and we told her that we still haven\\'t gotten our food. We had to tell her we didn\\'t have our food! We tell her we want to see the manager again. He comes over and asks us if the ticket in his hand is our ticket and says he can give us $20 off. Meanwhile we STILL do not have our food. Really Brian (manager), really?! All you can do if take off $20 off of 4 meals with drinks at this already overpriced hooters?!?

I explained that I was very worried about my puppy and felt she needed to be evaluated.  I was told that I could come in as a \"walk-in\" but would have to pay a $77.00 walk in fee on top of any exam or x-ray etc.   Quite frankly I was shocked!

My husband got a burger - which he said was nothing exciting.  I ordered the 3 cheese pasta - the description on the menu sounded really good.  When they put the plate down in front of me the cheese sauce looked orange and I knew that meant one thing - cheese from a can - YUCK!!!!!!  It was terrible.

       " 'As a good friend & I entered the N9ne corridor, Pat Sajak hurriedly sauntered past us as if Vanna White was in an upstairs suite waiting for him; interesting start to the night.   A stunning hostess asked if we wanted a table because we could be seated right away.  We thought it would be busy and planned to eat at the bar. Thankfully we stuck to that plan.\\n\\nThe meal started with a pair of appetizers: Ahi Tuna Tartare & fried Rock Shrimp.  The delicious shrimp had a light breading that added texture that did not overpower the shrimp.  The assorted dipping sauces were very good but the shrimp could stand alone on its own.  I had less of a liking to the tuna tartare.   What I did not like was the tuna appeared smashed so much that you could not tell if it was indeed tuna being served.  Perhaps I was expecting a presentation of \"ahi-poke\" cubes of tuna where the freshness of meat could be seen and appreciated.  To me it seems that if the tuna is smashed beyond the point of being unrecognized, it\\'s just a way of masking the quality & freshness of the fish.\\n\\nDespite the very small disdain I had for the tuna tartar, it did not make me less excited for my main dish; the 28 oz bone in Prime-Rib.  Dear Fellow-Yelpers, let me tell you: it was FANTASTIC!  What was put in front of me was a \"Brontosaurus rib-meat\" that only Fred Flintstone could appreciate; it was intimidatingly large.  I could see the perfect reddish-pink of medium-rare that was under au jus poured on the prime-rib.  Upon the first slice, I realized that I could have used a straw to cut into the very tender meat.  The first bite was so breathe taking that I truly did pause and almost cried.  Our server saw this and asked if I was okay, but I held up my index finger as if to say \"give me a moment while I appreciate all that is good in the world.\"  She smiled and left me alone to enjoy the rest of my bite.\\n\\nNeedless to say, I savored every bite that could muster of my prime rib.  The au jus is a bit different than most I have experienced in that it contains more of an \"herb\" flavor than salty.  That was fine by me because it complemented the already salted outer crust of the meat.  The fat content in the meat was perfect; not too much but just enough to keep the flavor and juiciness intact.  My only regret was that I was unable to finish my Bronto-rib and had to sheepishly ask for a to-go box.  My \"swag\" took a hit and I had to turn in my \"man-card\" for such an offense of not being able to consume such an excellent piece of prime-rib.\\n\\nDespite the meal, what really made me give my 5 star rating of N9ne was the service.  Jasmin from Lanai, you are a Superstar!!   As we sat at the bar through the entire meal, my friend and I attentively watched Jasmin\\'s hair flip over her shoulders with each sexy head twirl.  Yes, it is relatively easy for two cocktail infused men to observe a beautiful woman do anything but this was completely different.  Working alongside Jasmin was the spiky haired, broad shouldered, Latin accented Roberto.  What I saw was teamwork personified.  \\n\\nRoberto & Jasmin worked behind the bar like a fine tuned machine.  Need a bottle that was out of reach?  Roberto was there reaching upward for Jasmin.  Need to replace an emptying bottle of vodka?  Jasmin was there full bottle in hand for Roberto as he poured the bottle\\'s last drop.  I watched Roberto quickly make a 16 shot order for a large dinner party. Jasmin was there handing each possible ingredient as he poured them into the drink shaker.  Now there wasn\\'t any bottle twirling, tossing, or singing \"The Hippy-Hippy Shake\" while this teamwork was happening but it was a pleasant side show to appreciate.  Done with laughs & playful bickering like a happy married couple, Roberto & Jasmin worked together perfectly all night.  When there is genuine laughter & joy in the workplace, it can only reflect positively in the product which is served to the customers.\\n\\nShould you dine at N9ne and have an opportunity to eat at the bar, please do so.  Jasmin & Roberto will do little things like constantly replace your cocktail napkin under your drink just because it got soggy from condensation.  It shows the amount of pride they have to keep their work area clean & presentable to the customer.  This can only translate in being attentively served & making sure you receive the best possible dining experience; isn\\'t that what we all should want?\\n\\nAnd should you dine at the bar, if your cellular phone needs a a charging, Jasmin will gladly unplug a work device behind the counter and use one of her needed outlets to bring your very important phone to full power.  Need to order a drink or a refill?  Make sure you snap your fingers multiple times in the air for all at the bar to see & yell out \"HEY, CUTIE!\", Jasmin LOVES that and will make sure you are served first and without disdain.\\n\\nThank you very much to the entire staff at N9ne for making my visit a most memorable one; a return is imminent.',\n",

My son had the mac n cheese with bacon and ham and chicken tenders which all come with dessert and a drink for around $5. They have a kids program for teacher's, coaches or volunteers to reward children with Honerary kids meal's certificates. The manager was extremely friendly and came out to discuss this with me.

The sauce this dish comes with complements each flavor and soaks in to the delicious pile of rice.  This dish is a must try!\\n3. Seco de carne- Beef stewed in cilantro and Peruvian spices, rice, potatoes, peas, and carrots. If I could have one meal for the rest of my life -this would be it.  The beef is slow cooked and falls apart with your fork. I almost passed out when I tried this dish. Food can't possibly this good- can it? Yes! \\n\\nWhat I like most about his restaurant, is that it doesn't know how good it is. In other words, they are continually trying to improve on perfection with their meals. They are not cutting corners!  The qualities of meat they use are top notch, and the portions are substantial. Prices are moderate, as you can expect to pay 15-20 per entrée.  The place also does well as a takeout option. Last time I got food to go, it was still piping hot when I got home (15 minutes later). \\n\\nI love it here, and wish everyone in Las Vegas would give this place a try. If you have never had Peruvian food--this is the place to go.\",\n",

Yes, they have the crab legs. Yes, they have the melted butter that goes with it too! Yes, they have creme brulee! And if it's out on the floor, yes, they will also have Kobe beef :9'' Yum!\\n\\nTips to survive the Buffet at Bellagio\\n\\nTip#1: DO NOT GET TOO MUCH OF ONE THING\\n\\nIf any person knows the best way to eat at a buffet, it's ME! You take a little of everything here and there for a little taste.  Think of the buffet as uncharted territory and Capt. Stomach has sent you on a mission to find the best eatery and bring it back to base.  You're sent on a recon out and you're faced with an amalgam of tastes and smells EVERYWHERE! If it looks good and smells good, take a little to see if it tastes good; especially if it's your first time trying it. Do not grab a pound of the mediterranean salad, take a bite, and dump it. Please. And if it tastes good, don't get too much because there's a million other things to try here also!\\n\\nTip #2: Create a plan!\\nMake a map even! Walk around the buffet first to see what you're working with a keep a mental of what's where, what everyone is going for, what seems to be the most popular item on the buffet line. Do all of this so you know where to start. Don't just start picking and grabbing here because unlike the other buffets, I've noticed this to be the most cultured of cuisines. I'm not talking about tacos and orange chicken-culture. I'm talking about bistro-worthy eats that you won't find at a Taco  Bell or a Panda Express!\\n\\n\\nTip#3: Start light and work your way up!\\n\\nSo you're out on the buffet line, empty plate in hand, and you're a hunter with a hunger. Start light with their salad. It's on it's own island so you're won't have too much trouble finding it. Sounds epic doesn't it? Haha! There's also a little sushi bar. Sometimes they'll even have beef tartare! Mmmm. Then after you've warmed your insides, take a tour of the seafood: crab legs THAT ARE ALREADY CUT (awesome!), the sea bass is GREAT as also. If you're lucky to come at a time when they have Kobe beef, get some! It's absolutely scrumptous! It is extremely tender and melts like butter in your mouth!\\n\\nIf you're a local, take your friends here if they really want a taste of what Las Vegas buffets and food is all about! Enjoy and happy eating! :)\",\n",

       " 'I just had to write this review. I could not let another day of my life pass without doing so, Especially after seeing this this post by someone who is either related to or are friends with the person who owns this business. Lies I tell you...all lies!\\n\\nLet me start by saying that i fell in love with Charly. She does have a nice, helpful personality over the phone. She seemed like she was going out of her way to help me, but in reality she was only helping herself.\\n\\nHer wigs are w-a-y overpriced for the lack of quality that they are. You would think that with the price tag on those wigs, you\\'d get something worthwhile - NOPE. You are sadly mistaken.\\n\\nPlease don\\'t listen to that persons review. My review is the real deal. I have alopecia totalis so, I have been wearing wigs for YEARS - and this is, by far, one of the worst wigs I have ever gotten. There\\'s only 1 other company which had such bad hair. They both were delivered to me from around the same area in the Peoples Republic of China.\\n\\nFirst off, I asked if she could make a wig with the deep wave texture that I love and I showed her the pics of exactly what I wanted. She said she could do it. I said I wanted both the lace and firm grip in the darkest brown color. Not a  problem. Fine.\\n\\nThe wig actually looked cute when I got it, but it looked like someone took a curling iron and put in some Shirley Temple curls. That\\'s not what the deep wave is all about. So  I took a piece of the hair and wet it to see if the curls would still be there. You guessed it - nope almost all of the curl was gone. When I complained, she had the nerve to ask me if I wanted the curl to be in the deep wave texture in its natural state. Duh. I use this texture of hair a lot, and I\\'ve never had it revert after wetting it for the very first time.\\n\\nThe silicone (firm grip) on it was not dark brown. It was a clear/whitish color and very visible on my skin. The parts of the wig that had a little of the scalp showing through didn\\'t look natural at all. Needless to say this doesn\\'t look well on a dark skinned person like myself, which is why I requested that in the first place.\\n\\nI requested for a different wig because it wasn\\'t what I ordered. Ms. Charly wasn\\'t having that.\\nShe didn\\'t agree with some of my complaints, however she did say that 2 things were wrong and said she would have them corrected. It took awhile for me to get it back. When I did get it,  I thought to myself that the hair looked good. Trust me that feeling didn\\'t last long. The hair was awful. Keep in mind that this is day 1. \\n\\nAgainst her advice I combed out the wig with a wide tooth comb and wet it so the wig would look uniform and put together. I do this every time I have this type of hair - and by the way, with no problem. After all it is human hair. Right? This time it did hold the curl a little better. This is because they permed it again. This hair was now totally fried! By the time it was halfway dried the wig looked like a short afro with a slight curl to it. Trying to put it up in a ponytail was useless. It really looked ridiculous! I tried wearing it \"hanging\" out with a scarf on  As the day went on I looked crazier and crazier. This hair had a life of it\\'s own. I don\\'t ever plan on wearing this again.\\n\\nMy insurance paid for this wig. Had I come out of my own pocket to pay for this...surely she would have been in court so I could get EVERY penny of my money back! I feel like this is a public service announcement and I am warning everyone to please do yourselves a favor and steer clear of this business.

I have seen this countless times, at nightclubs: boring after boring song comes on, but when the DJ plays Britney suddenly the room erupts.  Very few performers had the ability to do this, in history.  Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley, Judy Garland... the names on this list are surprisingly few.  However, Britney Spears is one of them.  She has the power to illuminate a room, and the World, with her work.  I am not quite sure she realizes this, she is probably far too humble, which is an integral part of  her mysterious Greatness... but I digress.\\n\\nI did not feel the staff at the Axis theater were worthy of her.  They were rude, rushed me into my seat and out of the theater just as soon as they could, and I barely had time to buy a tee- shirt.

These people need to realize how much being in that theater means to some people... it is almost a spiritual experience.  When Britney levitated from the tree during Toxic, I almost felt my soul levitate, too! \\n\\nShame on them, for poisoning such a momentous experience.  As usual, ignorant peons in the world will spoil Greatness.  But there is enough negativity in the world, a point I think Spears herself combats with her positive soul and music.  There need not be any negativity in the arena of a performer who does so much to expunge the world\\'s ugliness, and there need not be unhappiness spread in the very Pantheon where Spears herself is employed to make us happy.  She was born to make us happy, that is her soul\\'s purpose... so let her do so without the grumblings of those who can only think of what they are going to have for dinner after their shift is over. \\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nNicholas Kafantaris',\n",

Another one I like is arrabiatta (spicy) with hot Italian soppressatta and tomato sauce. The flavour is exceptional, the dough is fresh and more importantly, it's thin and almost crispy. I also order their house salad, which is always fresh and completely customizable.\\n\\nI find it to be slightly pricy for a more casual type family restaurant, but it's totally worth it. I've been a handful of times and it never disappoints.\",\n",
       " 'I would like to share the most wonderful and positive experience that I had ever had with any music store in my whole life.  I am from California and found out about the \"Kessler & Son\\'s Music store during my web searches. I was on a mission to help find my son what I termed \"a horn that would have a magical feel and sound quality to it while being played\". I too being a trumpet player myself had a good idea and started to take my son out to different music stores locally here in CA and trying different horns but never found the right horn. He liked the way my older vintage Mt. Vernon Bach Strad played so I had a good idea what he was looking for. I ended up calling Kessler & Son\\'s and spoke with Dave Kessler. He certainly is one knowledgeable fellow when it comes to Bach Stradivarius trumpets. In that very first conversation with Dave and all my questions I had for him he helped educate me on what horn might work out the best for my son. I didn\\'t realize that 30-40 minutes had already elapsed. Wow! Finally a man with a passion for what he is doing takes an appropriate amount of time to make sure that we as customers are making an educated decision in purchasing a musical instrument. As opposed to how fast can I hang up the phone I\\'ve got other things to do (other music stores attitude) I actually had a conversation like I was standing right next to Dave Kessler. We decided that the Bach 37 Strad with the Sterling Plus Silver Bell was the way to go! I ordered it on THUR and received the horn the very next day, FRI. Double boxed and packed appropriately this horn arrived safely. When my son came home and noticed his surprise waiting for him he happily put his mouthpiece on it and started ripping off a few notes and chuckled and said this is it....this is the best trumpet I have ever played! He said mom & dad...this is like Christmas! Thank you Kessler & Son\\'s Music Store, mission accomplished. Ted V.',\n",

I suppose one should worry when this happens, but we were all hungry and wanting to get on with our days.\\n\\nService initially was great!

(Much appreciated!)\\n\\nFood took longer than it should have to come out. However my wrap was decent, as was my side salad.  Not memorable by any means, but certainly not cringe worthy either.\\n\\nThey lost major points by switching out our server mid-way through. Gone were the drink refills.

(3.5 stars).\\n\\n\"Colorado lamb, herb pumpkin seed crust, mole verde, crispy squash blossoms, & grilled calabaza.\"\\n\\nHaving no idea what half of this stuff was, I just blindly agreed to try this dish.\\n\\nAfter all, this is the dish that brought my friend & her hubby back for another meal!!\\n\\nI absolutely adore lamb, but the BF is indifferent to it, so when I find people who are willing to try new dishes with me, I\\'m ALL IN!!\\n\\nThe lamb itself was prepared beautifully.\\n\\nMedium-Rare please!\\n\\nPerhaps I\\'m just not used to Pepita (pumpkin seeds) being used as a crust or the mole verde which is made primarily from pumpkin seeds & green chiles.\\n\\nThe mole verde wasn\\'t bad, it was creamy, but didn\\'t have much a flavor profile I could discern. Aside from adding moisture to the lamb, I felt the mole got lost.\\n\\nI think I watch too much Food Network. When I saw fried squash blossoms I was thinking of the bright orange-red flower that gets fried in tempura batter. I didn\\'t see that anywhere on our plate??\\n\\nI didn\\'t even try the grilled calabaza (West Indian pumpkin) because I didn\\'t know where it was on the plate??\\n\\nThis dish really celebrated the PUMPKIN in my humble opinion. NOT THE LAMB. If I had known what all these fancy items were before I tried the lamb, I quite possibly could have been prepared myself for a less dramatic crescendo.\\n\\nI was secretly hoping for chimichurri sauce... *Sad Face*\\n\\nDefinitely a lesson learned for me, if I don\\'t know the ingredients, GOOGLE before trying.\\n\\nNothing against my friends or Chica, I just enjoy big bold flavors & chimichurri sauce!!\\n\\nPorchetta with Crispy Yuca Hash - $36. (4.5 stars).\\n\\n\"Suckling roast pig, crispy brussel sprouts, fried yuca, pearl onions escabeche, & pork jus.\"\\n\\nI honestly thought this was going to be my favorite dish of the evening... but there\\'s actually a tie?!\\n\\nI love pork so much I swear I OINK every time I speak!!\\n\\nI watched the spit rotate for a while with these giant porchetta roasting over an open flame. What a glorious moment it was!!\\n\\nThe porchetta was roasted perfectly & was served piping hot & crispy!!\\n\\nCutting into the porchetta was so satisfying. The meat was so tender on the inside & crispy on the outside.\\n\\nThat crispy pork skin was excellent!!\\n\\nThe brussel sprouts absorbed all of the rich pork jus & which added a nice flavor to my favorite vegetable! It was almost as good as having brussel sprouts with bacon!!\\n\\nI can still imagine licking the fatty porky juices off of my lips... Mmmm. Good!\\n\\nMeyer Lemon Rotisserie Chicken - $26 (Half Order: 4 pcs). (4 stars).\\n\\n\"Famous Rotisserie Chicken, marinated in Meyer Lemon & slow roasted to perfection, with Peruvian purple potato salad, & chimichurri.\"\\n\\nNow on to the biggest surprise of the evening.\\n\\nFor those who know me, I really enjoy CRISPY fried chicken.\\n\\nHaving just tried Yardbird (next door, same owners) & being quite disappointed in my non-crispy chicken, I wasn\\'t really expecting to enjoy a roasted bird.\\n\\nBoy was I mistaken!!\\n\\nThis chicken was roasted on an open flame!\\n\\nThe skin wasn\\'t terribly CRISPY so I had a little bit of a challenge eating the chicken on its own. I guess it\\'s the same texture that makes me remove the skin from my cold ginger chicken... I\\'m not a huge fan of flaccid skin.\\n\\nThe Meyer Lemon flavor is evident & gives a brightness to this dish.\\n\\nThe CHIMICHURRI SAUCE at Chica was phenomenal!! This sauce could be put on a fast food burger & I would eat it!! \\n\\nNote: I LOATHE FAST FOOD SO THAT IS SAYING A LOT!!\\n\\nWhat makes the chimichurri sauce my star of the evening is the robust & intense garlic, olive oil, & parsley flavors. I thought I noted some cilantro in this sauce but I could be wrong.\\n\\nOMG, some of my favorite items in the world... all in one bright green sauce.\\n\\nAfter slathering a dollop of chimichurri onto my plate, I silently cursed myself for telling my friend to order \"just a half\".\\n\\n---\\n\\nWhile our server was extremely personable & friendly, I have to say the wait staff was a different story.\\n\\nWe had a few plates that were sitting for a while with a brussel sprouts here, a yuca hash there.

       " 'I had a very bad experience at this hotel because the three staff I dealt with, which included the manager, Ken, have horrible people skills.  It is a long story, however, the short story is that they say they are pet friendly and if your dog makes a peep, they will threaten to call the police on you.  I tried to work with them by asking to move us to a less trafficked area, and they refused.  (we moved to another hotel in the middle of our stay, Country Inn which is down the street and they agreed to put us in a light trafficked area.  And there was no problems with dog barking.) However, when I contacted the corporate because the manager promised a comped room for the night we did stay because he basically kicked us out, they did help a lot.  And they credited us back the charge that the manager put on my card after promising not to charge us for the room.  It was very sneaky.  The hotels are beautiful, we stayed at a few La Quintas and were treated very well and never had a problem with the dogs.  I always ask for a light trafficked areas because dogs do bark when people walk by constantly, yet they put us by a very trafficked area right by the door.  I may consider using the other La Quintas again in the later future now that corporate handled it so well.  But never will I stay at this particular one again.  I did suggest that the staff at this hotel needs training on how to deal with the public.  It was a lovely hotel though, but the walls are very thing, we heard many dogs barking and kids screaming as well, but to us, it is to be expected.',\n",

Admittedly, I didn\\'t have any legit reasons for staying away from Indian food,and my wife finally got me to take her out for some. \\nWe tried Taj Mahal because we got a coupon in the mail - goes to show how a little marketing can go a long way. Our other choice would have been Tandoori Times, which we saw featured on \"Check Please\", but the coupon ended up being the deciding factor. \\nWe chose to try the lunch buffet. Our understanding is that when they opened a year ago, they pulled they buffet because it was so slow in the summer, but now it is back. \\nWe showed up at 1pm and were the only guests there, which made me a little nervous. The buffet was tucked away in a side room, with not the greatest presentation. It wasn\\'t very inviting. Those worries were quickly assuaged by the food itself! My biggest gripe ended up being that the plates stacked for the buffet were not all clean - some still had food crusted on it. I had to go through the stack to pick out the cleanest plate. If I was the manager there, I would put a little more focus on \"dressing up\" the buffet, just for the sake of visual appeal, make it more inviting. And always have clean plates lol. \\nI started with some rice and then sampled every offering in the buffet - there was a variety featuring crispy fried veggie balls, spinach paneer, tikka masala, curry chicken, lamb vindaloo, lentils, tandoori chicken, and a few others. \\nPlain and garlic Naan were brought to our table, separate from the buffet.\\nAll the food was excellent! The meat was tender, and the sauces were delicious. I went back 2 more times to help myself to a few of the items I really enjoyed (which was almost all of them lol). In particular, the lamb vindaloo stood out - it was so savoury and tender.\\nFor me the weakest link in the buffet was the tandoor chicken - the chicken legs themselves were not that great, too fatty and mushy. But everything else was really fantastic!  Consider me sold on Indian food, I am ready to try more after eating at Taj Mahal. \\nThe service was also top notch - you can immediately tell this is family run. The owner came to our table to chat, and was very engaging and very proud of his restaurant. I imagine he visits every table and chats with all the guests, that just seemed to be the overall vibe. Other people trickled in as we dined, and some were already on a first-name basis with the staff. Always a good sign! By the time we left, the business had picked up a bit - I guess we showed up during a dead time of 30 mins or so, so in retrospect was not an issue. \\nI took a peek at the menu before leaving, and it was pretty large, featuring all the meats, fish, shrimp etc cooked in every style possible. My wife confirmed that it was a pretty extensive Indian menu, she couldn\\'t think of anything missing. The owner assured us that any dish can be ordered at any level of spiciness, accommodating all sorts of taste parameters. The buffet was noticeably toned down, which made sense, and to be honest was PERFECT for me - I didn\\'t want anything too spicy or overly pungent. While it didn\\'t challenge me, the buffet more than made up for that by being very homey and comforting. \\nAnd that\\'s the big takeaway from Taj Mahal.... I found this Indian food experience to be COMFORTING above all else. It seems more like eating at an Indian grandmother\\'s kitchen, than a fancy restaurant that tries to \"elevate\" common dishes. Seems like they stick to the basics, without getting fancy, and do a fantastic job. For an Old Town Scottsdale establishment, it was not pretentious or arrogant - it was comforting and confident. \\nWhile expanding my Indian food experience probably means trying other places, we definitely intend on returning to Taj Mahal to try their full menu after having enjoyed the buffet.',\n",
       " \"I went into this store in search of a vape since I just broke mine. The staff was sweet to help me out while I was there. When I got home I realized the extra coil and manual were missing. Also, everywhere else I looked online was half the price. I am not as upset about that because time was a factor in this decision. The next day I called them to ask about refunds, they said they don't\\u200b give refunds and that it states that in the store. I informed them that the product was unused and was sold to me with missing parts and they still didn't\\u200b budge. At least I didn't\\u200b waste gas money for them to say no in my face.

It\\'s a fun bar and you can sit in the letters of revolution. Nice and cute server too and it\\'s pricey, but it\\'s Vegas!\\n\\nFor the show we had the perfect seats. We were 6 rows up (above the VIP section) and right in the center. I will say this again- for Cirque Du Soleil, you do not want to be too close. Last time I went to a show and sat VIP I constantly had to move my head back and forth to see what was happening and felt that I missed a lot for lack of peripheral vision. This time this did not happen. We were far enough back that we could see the whole stage and all that was happening. Cirque shows usually have so much going on at the same time, and this show was no exception. I definitely recommend sitting further back to try and catch all that is going on.\\n\\nSo the show was awesome. Obviously if you LOVE the Beatles (and who doesn\\'t?) you will enjoy it that much more. The whole show was very artsy and more like a choreographed dance/play than another show I\\'ve been to. It was very trippy and every song had it\\'s own different interpretation. It gave you a lot to think about and also had a lot of moments where you say, \" how did they do that??!!\"\\n\\nSo although I would have preffered a little more acrobatics and crazy stunts, the show was still very intertaining and pretty incredible.

The lady in billing was VERY nice I must say and apologized, she said the office schedules a physical every year in advanced for you, how kind. What a great way to make money - my wife got the same call and hasn't been a patient for longer than I. So had we not called to cancel, an appointment we never made we would have been charged a no show fee as indicated in the email I also received today.

It finally came out close to 30 minutes after the food came out. The waitress then brought out the two big soups that we ordered ...then four smaller soups followed. When we asked what the additional soups were, she replied that the bbq meal came with soup. \\n\\nWe were beyond angry. When we were placing the order, the waitress should have told us that the bbq meal came with soup so it wasn't necessary to order the two additional soups. They are the experts when it comes to the menu and she should have gone over the order with us. We clearly had no idea that we were ordering 4 small soups and 2 big ones.

The service was acceptable. \\nNow for the bad.\\nPrices,food quality, portion size, overly salty everything.\\nWife and hours we were there. Very limited menu and we certainly were eager to try the Latin flavors.\\nWe started with various small plate items. Pulled pork tacos, quacamole, Corn Pops. The Corn Pops were outstanding however 4 pieces equaled 2 small ears for 13.00 a bit much. 3 very very small tacos, extremely salty. Almost could not eat them as they were leased with salt. 3 sauces for the quac, were not tasty and again, laced with salt. Plantain chips were so salty we could not eat them. We ordered two cocktails that were not good either for having a mixologist. They were very heavy with mint. Overpowering. With that we decided not to proceed with dinner given the portions were so small, even for a small plate appetizer, it was a total rip off and again, over salty on everything. The waited asked what happened, we told him and he said oh well we have heard the salt thing before but that is Latin food. I said we have had Latin food before and it is not that way. With that we paid our bill and left unhappy. By the look of no one else in the restaurant I can't believe we are the only ones complaining about price, quality portion size.

If you can get an appointment, they won't document anything else you want looked at, they'll tell you to tell them when you come in (can't do it on the website either).

The guy brings me a phony cabin filter or bay filter everytime to upsale me and make me spend 80$ instead of 50$ for my oil change. I know it's phony because I have changed my cabin filter 3 days before my oil change once and the guy brought me the dirtiest filter ever and he looked like a deer in headlights when I told him that I literally JUST changed it...

When I heard that they were taking over The Avenue Bar, I was sad, but I gave it a shot.  I was even more sad when I saw the menu.  It\\'s meh. Nothing grand, just regular run of the mill fare, which is why I had a hard time choosing something.  Everything seems to come with some sort of aioli.  Aioli this, aioli that.  There are different condiments and sauces that would work, even better.  But I feel like they were trying to be sophisticated with \"aioli.\"  Not so much.   They are really fond of the brioche bun.

That\\'s hard to screw up. Sad that it only came with fries and there is an upcharge for the Yukon gold potatoes.  This was a fail.  First the batter tasted like flour, was greasy, tasteless mess.  Inside the batter goo was barely enough fish to call an appetizer.  For $14.95, with an upcharge for the Yukon potatoes, I expect something a little more substantial.  I\\'m not kidding when I tell you that the size of the fish portion was appetizer size.  Most of the size of the meal was the batter all puffed up.  Greasy. Ick.  And the potatoes.  They were supposed to be herb roasted. Roasted.  It seemed pretty clear they were par baked, then fried in the fryer because it was supposed to have herbs.  No herbs.

Not a bad version of this dish, pretty tasty but more peppery than ones i've had before. Also came with beans, rice and salad (plus I opted for flour tortillas). \\n\\n* Staff were on top of their game: drinks were refilled quickly, server brought 2nd round of salsa and bean dip without asking and food was taken and served pronto..\\n\\nSummary:\\nService was on Target *Bullseye!*, Well Decorated, Price was a bit high for the portions given and the Food was a Solid 4 Stars!\",\n",

At first she came immediately then (to my utter disappointment she dissappear ed for 20 minutes). Another waitress was wondering if we had been helped and even asked others where our waitress was. It was an embarrassing moment. We saw a server who has helped is before and the server greeted us.... We were not at that server's table. She even talked to that server as she pasted. Okay maybe she doesn't know I haven't been here before. I will give her that. It continues to get worse. \\n Finally  when she came around she made the person I came with so uncomfortable they left.

It was obvious from the way they offered that soup and salad was free and insisted I should take it home to that person (this is after I absolutely refused twice any soup, salad or cheese from them) the reason why my buddy left. This was unacceptable. How would they k ow if i am staying or visiting my buddy? Nope, just more assumptions. If a customer refuses a food item, the server should respect his or her wishes. This was only the begining. \\n   The other server brought me food. I understand if the restaurant was busy, but that was slightly rude.

Why would any sane person want the shrimp they asked to be taken away boxed? First of all I can only assume she thinks I am doing funny things to get free shrimp. I refuse anything of that notion. Secondly, I can only assume she thinks I am younger than most by my appearance only or because I am a certain ethnicity. I was never offered a sample of wine (even when I was with my buddy). Other times we were asked our age first then offered wine, but no this service was worse. I noticed at this a table with 11 people of a certain favorable age, favorable appearance, and ethnicity had already been served and left while I  wait. \\n So I was not happy and feeling quite disgusted at this point. I get the shrimp now and behold. Fewer shrimp plus shells. It smells like it was reheated (for the 15 minutes I had to wait). Thank  goodness I took a picture. It is obviously shown below the difference. I did not touch or eat anything on that plate for fear it had been tampered with. The manager was called in. I do not  believe she offered a name. She Offered to take the bill except for the appatiser I ate. I refused and paid the entire bill with cash because I was being nice. I left but forgot I would like to write a comment. Behold, it was past 10 already and the Hostess would not let me back in. Even though she saw me walk out a few minutes ago. Why? 'Safety reasons'. Probably because I was wearing a sweater, no makeup. I was finally let in due to the manager after waiting insistantly with the protesting hostess. At this point you can guess I was very upset. The manager asked if I wanted my change. That was the first thing she said to me. Not, how can I help you. Honey, I do not want money. ... probably once again from my ethnicity or age or appearance.

As an overall rating for others though, I would probably give it 4 stars .   \\n\\nAt $34.99 plus $10 for unlimited mimosas, I think the brunch is expensive but for my dollars, it delivers good value.   I expect to spend 2 to 3 hours being served small plates and trying new and old flavors of mimosas.    The food and mimosa menu is constantly changing, so if I get something I really like, I pretty much keep ordering that until I'm full.  A couple of years ago, I had a grapefruit mimosa there that was so good, I stopped eating so I could drink more of them!  Champagne with grapefruit, honey and a little gin.   So very good.   So good that I experimented until I got the recipe down for myself. \\n\\nI don't eat beef, chicken or pork, so my options are a bit limited but like I said, when they hit their mark with something, it is fantastic, like the SEASONAL FRESH FRUIT SALAD - housemade granola * lime zest * cayenne yogurt * buñelo cone .   Not only the flavors but the different textures of this dish are perfect.   \\n\\nThe beauty of the small plates is that if you don't like something, you can just stop eating it and get something else.   Even though the  menu changes and they may not serve something I really liked previously, it's fun to try new dishes and take the time to savor and rate them.\",\n",

       " 'I used to enjoy the food here and loved to come here as a local. My husband and I always take visiting relatives here, especially when we encourage them to stay at the South Point Hotel. I usually get the Seafood Diavolo, and always the calamari appetizer. Unfortunately, after my experience last night, I will never be back. I have tried almost everything on the menu, and the only thing that was subpar was the crab and avocado salad. Last night, my mom (who is visiting from California) and I met my aunt and uncle and cousin from Hawaii here since they are staying at the hotel. I told them they had to try it because it was surprisingly delicious. I ordered calamari for the table, which was extremely rubbery in texture. I was the only one eating it after everyone tried a piece. My mom had some clam chowder which was obviously decent. We decided to share the TWENTY-SIX dollar lobster grilled cheese. It was nothing close to a grilled cheese. The bottom piece of bread was so soggy, the inside contents of the \"grilled cheese\" seemed to have little or no cheese, and it tasted awful. I honestly do not believe that there was any real lobster inside. For the side, it came with stale kettle chips that seem to be house made...maybe earlier in the week? My cousin ordered the crab for $29 which came out barely warm, with an unlit candle for the butter sauce. My aunt had fish and chips which also came out hardly warm fries, and luckily the fish was hot. My uncle had the scampi and he said it was good. Our service was nothing special and we never received any refills. The calamari came out so late that it wasn\\'t really considered an appetizer. I felt bad that my aunt and uncle insisted on picking up the bill, but I was more so embarrassed that I had told them to try this place more than once, and the quality of the food and service was pretty awful. I am very disappointed. I feel bad for people who stay here and decide to \"splurge\" on a decent meal, since the prices aren\\'t very reasonable. I still am in shock that the grilled cheese was so bad and came with stale kettle chips for almost $30. It should be removed from the menu ASAP.',\n",

Little did we realize that Joe's had been sitting under our noses for years!\\n\\nWe have ordered twice so far - first time we both had the Big Joe's Burger combo. Warning: do not order unless you are really, really hungry because it is a lot of food and you will be very, very full. The fries are delicious - well seasoned, crisp, and yummy. You can tell they are homemade fries - super enjoyable. Now as for the burger we both chose to have it with cheese and bacon (I would recommend it that way) plus all available toppings. Phew - just thinking of that burger is making me feel full. Now, to be forewarned Joe's does cook their burgers very well done but I completely understand why. So if that turns you off, maybe you should find another burger joint. However, if you are still with me, then you will find that the burger is very well seasoned and has a lot of flavour. The toppings were all very fresh and delicious. All in all this burger combo was dynamite and I would much rather come to Joe's than any of the other fast food spots or diner style places. When you consider the prices at Joe's and the speed of the food - it really cannot be beat.\\n\\nNow, second time around I felt like trying the Falafel in pita combo. It was awesome. Again the toppings in the pita were phenomenal and the falafel were very crisp and really tasty. I would recommend this combo to anyone looking for a lighter option to the Big Joe's burger combo.\\n\\nTo wrap things up I would say this: if you are looking for higher quality food for lower prices and more options Joe's Hamburgers is a must. However, if you are stuck on having your burgers done medium or so, then carry on looking. \\n\\nUpdate: Now that I have had the shawarma in a pita I can tell you that it is amazing. So tasty and delicious plus you can order it with a variety of toppings and sauces to make it your own. Highly recommend!\",\n",

       " \"Folks, consider this review a friendly warning. I gave SAM WOO one star, but I would have given it half star if I could.  My wife and I had eaten at this place many times before when we visited Las Vegas in the past.  Face it, when you had several buffets, steaks and pizzas. you would really crave for a bowl of hot wonton noodle soup topped with roast duck on a cold night.  That's exactly what we ordered.  The food was decent before. This time, it had left a bad taste in my mouth.\\n\\nFor my story, first, let me set the scene so that you get the picture. We arrived Vegas on 24th.  After a few buffets and burgers. we wanted some Chinese food, so we decided to go to SAM WOO.  When we walked in, the place was completely mobbed and many large parties for 5 and up were waiting. Customers with waiting numbers were literally standing in front of the table where sat down customers were still eating. So it didn't take long  for a table for  2.  We were seated about 20 minutes later. We were given a small table very close to the aisle. The hostess slapped the menu on the table and since we knew exactly what we wanted, we waved at the waiter to order. He came but the whole time during my order, he never had eye contact with me. He came back minutes later with a pot of lukewarm tea and put down 2 tea cups which his had his thumb inside. \\n\\nThe tea tasted like it was served to the previous customer. It was barely warm. So we asked him for 2 glasses of iced water.  The wonton noodle soup and the chow-fun came after about 20 minutes. The soup was terrible. it was not hot and the wontons tasted like old chopped pork wrapped in soggy wonton skin with no shrimps them. It didn'ttaste like traditional wontons. After 30 years in business, this is how SAM WOO makes the wonton! And the noodle was soggy ( probably it sat in the soup too long. At this point, I thought a cup of Roman Noodle sounded pretty good, Chow Fun was ok though. So my appetite was somewhat ruined. We wanted to get out of the restaurant so bad as we were not happy with the food nor the service.  \\n\\nI waved at the waiter for the check. He gave me a bill for $24 but along with it, there was a white slip of paper with $27.60 written on it. I knew the 2 items should be about $20 before tax. I waved down the waiter and questioned him about the total. He had the gall to tell me, because of the holidays, there is a $ 1.00 per head tea charge, with tax it is 24. The 15% tip calculated after tax being added was mandatory. I said I didn't asked for the tea (which was cold), and if  tea charge is the new holiday policy, he should inform the customers before serving the tea. Anyway, I didn't want to hash it out with the waiter, so I left the money on the table for the check amount plus tax and 10% as his service. And I told the table next to me which was a family of 6 ordering many dishes about their sneaky practice. I advised them be watchful of the bill. I did notice a couple of big parties leaving cash tips on the table on top of the snuck-in tip on the bill without realizing the tips were already included on the bill. A large party could easily run up to a $100 - $120 even for noodles and soup. If the waiter sneaks in a 15% tip on a $100 bill, that is $15 dollars for service on the bill. If customers didn't look at the bill carefully and tip him again. That's shady practice! I hope the restaurant's management is reading this so that they can change their way of doing business. I truly believe the waiters would not dare to carry out this practice without the consent of the management. I used to work in the hospitality industry. There is no such thing as mandatory tip. Gratuity is a reward for good service rendered.  If an establishment forces the gratuity on the customers when the service is sub-par. the sneaking in the tip is bordering line committing a consumer fraud without prior information given to the customers. Every charge should be clearly listed on the check and additional special charges must be informed to the customers. When we make a reservation for a party more than 5 people, some restaurant will inform the customers there will be a 15% ( sometimes 20%) service charge on the bill. SAM WOO did not inform the customers and took advantage of the holidays and gambling on people feeling hesitant to make a fuzz.  I was about to ask to talk to the manager, but second thought, it was Christmas and the placed was crowded with people. So I did the next best thing, get out of there leaving what I believed the correct amount was plus 10% which is more than what he deserved.  \\n\\nI will never go back again. I believe a restaurant has to try hard to gain the customers' business and trust. As a customer, would you get yourself upset by eating in a place serving low quality food  and service was so lousy that you had to spend an hour writing and bitching about it!  Folks, stay away. If you do decide to eat there, watch for any discrepancy on the bill, the waiters are sneaky.\",\n",

When I got there, the cutting counter employee was alone and had about 7 people waiting for her to cut fabric.

Me, I just had one spool of ribbon, and I only wanted 9 inches.  I had to wait my turn through ladies with the shopping cartful of bolts to be cut.

From the beginning, we noticed she was curt and rude to us, but had not been to the previous customers.  We assumed she had a bias (3 gay men) but just ignored as we are occasionally accustomed to this, even in 2016.  I asked her what the flavor \"a salted special\" was to which she replied \"It\\'s up on the board\".  We knew at that time we were in for a problem with her.  I ordered and was very specific on the order:  \"3 different orders in 3 cups, one with hazlenut and 2 with a salted special\".  First, she was looking at the other customers and I had to repeat the same order.  She scooped 2 scoops in one cup and literally threw it up on the counter.  I asked her what that was she said \"it\\'s what you ordered\".  I told I did not order in same cup but all separately.  She argued the point and was quite nasty about it, so much so that the couple next to us in line looked up and then looked at us and shook their heads in disbelief to her rudeness with us.  She continued to be nasty and was slamming around the cups and scoop.  I then again told her to PLEASE be sure to separate out all 3 orders to which she replied \"I heard you the first time.\"  It was at this time that I told her that I had not been rude with her and she needed to adjust her attitude and communication with us.  She then threw the scoop and cup down and said \"I am not serving your kind in my store\".  We were shocked with this statement being that it is now 2016 and everyone has the same rights.  I then said we are cancelling the order.  She said \"get out or I am calling security\" (for what we did not know other than not being the lifestyle she wanted to serve).  We then left and went to CREAM, which by the way is just around the corner and down one block from this place.  The servers in CREAM obviously have had customer service training as they were EXTREMELY COURTEOUS.  The ice cream at CREAM is great, so save your money at Messina and go to CREAM, especially if you are of an alternative lifestyle!!!',\n",

       " \"Copied from the review I wrote on Verve Car Rental.  Made my reservation with Ace, but all receipts and credit card charges from Verve so just covering ALL the bases in an effort to warn others.  I would never rent from this company again.  \\n\\nI didn't realize when I made the reservation that I would have to take 2 shuttles from the airport to reach the rental location.  The shuttles run every 15 mins and there were so many people waiting I had to wait for the 2nd shuttle to get to the rental office (30 mins late now).  Then I had to wait in a long slow line to get the car (another 15 mins late), which looked like it had been hosed down and whatever dirt was on it just got smeared around and it had no license plate.  I figured that's why the price was so low and let it go.  I returned the car an hour earlier than my reservation so they charged me less than the original quote.  I got my receipt and left.  A month later my accounts payable processor asks me for a receipt for $4.51 charge.  My receipt total was $67.27 so I had to call to find out what the additional charge was for.  They said it was because I picked up the car late.  I explained why I was late arriving and the extra charge should have been on my receipt they gave me when I checked out, not charge me after the fact.  It's not a lot of money, but the fact they charged me after the fact make it unauthorized and unethical.  Can you imagine the extra revenue they earn if this is standard business practice and nobody notices or spends the time to investigate?  \\n\\nTurns out my car wasn't the only one with no license plate, so maybe this is a sham business to begin with?

Not only is it $10 to get into this sad fair, but you have to pay $20 to park in some sketchy lot. Then you most likely will have to cross the 6-way intersection to get to the entrance, which seems like it takes eternity. The area where you purchase your tickets is very small and cramped.  I came during a busy time ($2 before 2pm day). There seemed to be no real defined lines, just a crowd of people fighting to get to the front. Once I got inside, it was just endless stands of deep fried food and games you can never win at.  \\n\\nThere really is not much to do there.  I've been to fairs where there were petting zoos, barns full of animals, largest vegetable contests, antique entrees, and Elvis impersonators as well as other somewhat talented performers.The most exciting aspect of the fair was paying 25 cents to feed some ducks through a wire fence. However, HOWEVER, you are allowed to bring in your own food and drinks but if you don't, be prepared to fork over $9 for a beer, $3 for a bottle of water and $5 for one deep fried Oreo.  Good luck finding a water fountain, and if you do, it's probably out of order.\",\n",
       " \"Bed bugs. But the weird thing is that these guys would come in to spray or 'inspect' the apartments but all they do is walk into the bathroom and back out, gone in less than a minute. It's very creepy. My guess was that it was more of an inspection for drugs. Normal pest control protocol for inspection is checking for visible signs: couch, crevices... And the reason they are infested in the property is because they are never sprayed! Was afraid to say anything to management, in fear we would lose our 'home'. It wasn't worth the sleepless nights, financial cost of bringing the bugs with us, and the hassle. \\n\\nWhile living there, we had smelled strong ammonia in the second building. Though it does seem to be one of the better budget suites locally (less crime than the others) it just sucks that people in rough spots who aren't using drugs, have to smell drugs, deal with the 'ratchets' yelling in the pool all day and disgusting living conditions. Cops racially profile and scope the location every Saturday. Doesn't matter if you are a working non drug using civilian, they enjoy bothering everyone but the ones involved. I had a headache and became very ill staying there. I researched my symptoms and found them to match those of residing at and old or near a current meth lab. Yes, you can become ill, and it's dangerous. These places are okay if you need a place and can't find anything better, but not if you have children.

Well let me tell you that character counts! If a person is rude and unhelpful, you best believe they will treat you in the same manner if you have a problem. My problem is I paid him $40 to replace my soles on my work shoes, which is more than what I paid for the shoes. Nevertheless, the soft soles he told me were going to be put on were NOT.

Of course I was irritated that I got my shoes back damaged. He then told me I can just fix them myself. Rather than making a big scene I just wanted to get out of there and never return again, clearly this guy is not going to make things right. I asked him if there was a warranty for these soles? His reply was \"warranty, what\\'s that?\" I repeated myself and tried to explain what a warranty is. He says \"NO those soles will last longer than your shoes\".

They have Big Buck World, darts, and shuffleboard. It's not too dark inside. The decor is themed and fun to look at. It's not empty, but also not crowded, on weeknights.

I specifically made an appointment, because I had other appointments ALL week (I was flying out Friday evening.) When I arrived for my appointment, Savannah had not checked her appointments that day and was in the process of helping another customer. As I was standing right in front of her she checked the appointments and realized that she missed me. She asked me if I could come back at 7, but I had made plans right after my appointment. Normally I would have been fine with waiting but I clearly made an appointment because my schedule was hectic that week. I told her I could go do what I planned on doing after my appointment and be back by 7:15/7:30, because they closed at a certain time. Tammy (manager or owner) would not agree to that. Savannah asked me if Tammy could do my nails instead, I hesitated b/c I\\'m familiar with Savannah\\'s work but I proceeded to say yes (apparently they did not hear me). Savannah and Tammy switched customers so Savannah could do my nails. 3 days later (Friday) my nail broke so I went back to see if I could get it fixed. I stated that I did not have time to wait for Savannah and I was willing to pay someone else to fix (it was one nail and easy to fix). As Im waiting they call someone else who arrived AFTER me, so of course I questioned that as I previously stated that I would PAY someone else to fix. Eventually I hear Holly complaining to Savannah about me saying that I would have to pay to have someone else fix. So I interjected and stated what I already said, I don\\'t mind PAYING. Holly had the AUDACITY to call me difficult from my last visit (and she wasn\\'t even there that day!). How DARE you call a customer difficult when the customer MADE AN appointment!! Most businesses try to accommodate when THEY make an mistake. Regardless, who talks about customers in their presence?!? Tammy decided she wanted to argue with me b/c I didn\\'t want her to do my nails on the date of my appointment. Again, I had an APPOINTMENT with SAVANNAH for a reason, but I was still willing to have someone else do them. Savannah proceeds to tell me that she can\\'t accept any more appointments b/c they get busy, as she proceeds to take an appointment (from someone that I know) over the phone right in front of me . I was actually texting that person as she called to make the appointment. Now I will state that although Savannah forgot my appointment she is one of the sweetest nail techs I\\'ve ever met. This review is on the lack of professionalism of Holly and Tammy. It is clear from the way she is arguing with customers under their reviews that she lacks the basics of running a business. On my previous visits, they would complain about customers to me WHILE THEY WERE STILL THERE! that should\\'ve been a red flag. DON\\'T GO HERE!!!!

       " 'Bamburger is the latest entry into the inexpensive \"gourmet burger\" trend taking over Yonge Street, including Gourmet Burger Co., South Street Burger Co., Burger Shoppe and Gourmet Burger.\\n\\nWhile Bamburger offers a decent take-out menu, we chose to enjoy their small, but friendly sidewalk patio, right in the middle of restaurant row at Yonge and Davisville. Bamburger is appealingly decorated in dark brown, natural wood and lots of greenery complimenting the patio and the booths. The lighting is soft and the seating is cozy. This is the kind of place that you could hang out for a great meal without the rushed \"diner\" feeling that often comes with burger joints. Our server was friendly, talkative and more than willing to explain the options on the menu, as there are many, and recommend some personal favourites.\\n\\nStarting off with drinks, Bamburger serves beer, wine, and old-fashioned Stewart\\'s soda, but what is a burger joint without milkshakes? Bamburger specializes in milkshakes, including the usual vanilla and chocolate suspects, as well a special flavour each day for the nice price of $3.95.\\n\\nThe menu is varied, offering up soup, salads, sandwiches and desserts, as well as a kid\\'s menu, but almost everyone here is in it for the burgers. Bamburger allows you to choose almost every aspect of your burger, from the type of bun, burger patty (beef, chicken, turkey, pork or veggie), as well as a plethora of toppings, some for the asking- tzatziki, chipotle mayo, olives, horseradish, pickles and banana peppers, and some for a price, $1-$1.50 each- bacon, avocado, onion rings, mushrooms, pineapple, and every kind of cheese you could imagine. Included in these cheesy wonders is \"Bamburger\\'s Signature Cheddar Cheese Sauce ($1.50),\" and it is worth every penny. You can order the cheese sauce on your burger, or as a side for dipping your fries, and I would highly recommend both. Just try not to think of how much butter and cheese have gone into that little bowl, and instead, focus on how delicious it is!\\n\\nWe went with the \"Bambamburger ($11.50),\" which is 2/3 of a pound of prime ground chuck, and the chicken burger ($9.95) for myself, on whole-wheat buns. Both of us outfitted our burgers with toppings galore, including mushrooms, onions, garlic mayo and cheese sauce for the \"Bambamburger,\" and avocado, chipotle mayo, dill pickles and jalapeno peppers for the chicken burger. Our meals took a while to arrive, as everything is cooked from scratch, but when they did, we received two overflowing burgers, with awesome homemade French fries and onion rings to match. Lesson learned from this particular trip to Bamburger is just because all of these delectable toppings are available, it doesn\\'t mean you should put all of them on your burger. We both lost our buns to the slippery extras, and ended up eating our burgers by topping, not as one cohesive piece.  Next visit I will try a couple toppings at a time, and see if I fare any better.\\n\\nBamburger serves up great burgers, fries and shakes at a fairly good price, although if you go a little overboard with the toppings, you might quickly end up with a $20 burger, without realizing it. The service was friendly and engaging, and the atmosphere was very comfortable and neighbourly.\\n\\nIf you are hunting for a real deal on a burger, Bamburger might not be what you are looking for, but if you are more on the adventurous side, and want to have fun creating your own burger masterpiece, Bamburger will deliver.',\n",

       " 'WARNING: DO NOT USE LARRY\\'S TOW!!! Unless you want a really bad experience! SAD!!!\\n\\nFirst and only negative review (I do not like negatives, but this a must to warn others!)\\n\\nSame complaint submitted to BBB and formal verbal complaint to AAA:\\n\\nAt approx. 1500 hrs, on 08/15/17, I called AAA Premier Service to request a 185-mile (flat-bed)tow from Primm Outlet Mall, Primm, Nevada (Nevada Stateline with California)to Rancho Cucomonga, CA (the closest friend\\'s address).  AAA referred to Larry\\'s Towing in Las Vegas, Ca as their contract Towing company.  I called Larry, the owner, who explained the 185-mile tow would take 6 hours due to slow speed/DOT regulations/and vehicle inspections.  Larry said he had no driver.  So, they would take my SUV to the tow yard and tow it at 1800 hrs, arriving in Ranco Cucamonga about midnight. I was OK with it: provided all info to Employee Jacob, secured SUV, and headed back to California with another person.  Arrived home at 1930 hrs., I called Larry\\'s Tow and Jacob told me they did not tow the SUV, \"The guy (tow truck driver) showed up but it was too hot. So, he didn\\'t want to work and went back to Wyoming.\"  Jacob they would tow in the morning, new shift at 0600 hours.  \\n\\nAt approx. 0830 hrs., on 08/18/18, I called Larry\\'s towing and spoke with a female (Jenny/Denise?) who said my SUV was still in tow yard, and waiting for a driver.  I advised her I and a friend had taken a day off to wait for my SUV in Rancho Cucamonga, friend\\'s house.  She said she will call me in an hour.  No calls received (ever!). At 1000 hrs., I called again and same lady said no driver available and will call me with updatest.  No calls received, again.  \\n\\nAt 1110 hrs. I arrived at friend\\'s house in Rancho Cucamonga to waid for my SUV.  At 1230 hrs., I called again, explained needing the vehicle towed and no communication, same lady said she was still waiting for driver and will call me back.  No calls received.  At 1530 hours. (24-hours after initial call for service), I called and spoke with Larry, the owner, and explained this ridiculous circumstances of waiting more than 24 hrs to tow my vehicle - only credit: the lady and Larry did apologize - but it\\'s too late.  Larry claimed his only flat bed truck had problems and was getting service quote from Ford dealership.  I told him that in the past 24 hours, I was the only person calling and checking on a tow that had not occurred and no one from Larry\\'s Towing had called or text me with any updates at all - unexcusable and extremely poor customer service, very disappointing as my friend and I had lost a day of work waiting. Larry asked if it was 2-wheel drive which I told him it was, same said 24 hours ago. Larry suggested a regular tow (having my 2-wheel on ground while towing)and I was OK with it.  Larry said they driver would tow at 1800 hours but Larry could not promise the time, giving excuse of hooking up and inspectint vehicle.  I asked if Larry could promise to be out of tow yard and head to California before 1900 hours,and CALL/NOTIFY me. Larry could not commit. My friend drove me home at 1600 hours. \\n\\nAt approximately 0230 hours, on 08/17/17, my friends texted me that my SUV had just arrived at his house in Rancho Cucamonga (34 hours after original call of service!).  The newly 2-week employed driver told my friend that he left the tow yard at approx. 2100 hours, 08/16/17. I arrived friend\\'s house at 1300 hours and noticed an 18\"+ deep scratch diagonal accross the hood of my SUV (damaging it!), can see the white primer under blue paint and clear coat.  My friend said the tow truck driver has a magnetized flashing light on top of hood used during the tow.  My SUV was tow front facing backward with two rear wheels lifted/hooked up to tow truck.  Unbelieble towing experience: complete dishonesty, incompetence, and lack of business sense and/or care for customer. None.  Worst customer service experience in my 31 years of driving and 23 years of working as law enforcement officer - still current.  I have filed a formal complaint to AAA.  \\n\\nDuring the 34 hours tow ordeal, Larry and none of his employee had never called or text me with any updates, advise, anything - so sad that this kind of incompetent business dealing exist!  I did not know about other YELP and BBB complaints until I researched during the 2nd day waiting for my suv!  I didn\\'t mind the wait as much as the lack of communication, stringing me a long for hours and hours without calling - that is a total BS!!!\\n\\nLarry - please revampt/change your business practice and you will make a lot more money with really happy customers who will truly respect, enjoy doing (repeated) business with you, and will do free advertsing for you!

I went to Amanda for full highlights and the result was the worst color job I've ever had in my life. I knew once she removed the foils and saw the color, I was in trouble. She blow dried my hair and the color seemed okay in that lighting so I paid and left and once I got outside and looked in the mirror, I realized the highlights are very splotchy and uneven but more importantly the color goes from orange to red. I went home and showed my boyfriend and he legitimately laughed and said my hair looked like tiger stripes gone wrong. I went back to her salon immediately and very politely explained that it looks super orange/red and the sides were huge stripes of zigzagged lines and she apologized and did another toner, which really didn't help as much as I thought it would. I had New Year's Eve plans tonight and I had to cancel because I am embarrassed to have anyone see my hair like this. You can see in the photos, the highlights are blonde in some spots, red in others and the foils were not placed well which left harsh uneven lines. I called another salon and scheduled an appointment for Monday and when I sent the hair stylist photos, she said I will need a color correction and I'm looking at $200 to fix a botched $60 highlight job. This was the worst color job I've ever had in my life and I'm incredibly upset that my entire New Years weekend became ruined because of it. I will not be returning.\",\n",

We went there for Mother\\'s day 2016 - everyone in our party was Mexican, but me..  It took 15 minutes after we were seated to have our server Erin come over and greet us and take our drink orders.  She seemed like she didn\\'t want to be there that day; she never smiled, she was monotone, and literally did everything thing in the book to lessen her tip.  \\n\\nWe had a party of 6 and sat outside(eventually 7) - we were seated at two small round tables that were pushed together.  These small tables are fine for small parties, but not for larger groups in a communal setting.  When our app\\'s (guacamole fresco, queso blanco con chorizo - we ordered the fried jalapenos later..) came out, we couldn\\'t even share across tables b/c you had to actually stand up or pass the app over to the other person.  \\n\\n\"Hot Taco\" this is something you should consider on the patio; a 4\\'x8\\' rectangle for larger parties.  \\n\\nAfter placing our drink order it took another 10 minutes to get the WATER to our table, and the margaritas and other mixed drinks took even longer.  I will say that she told us that they are short a server, but that is not my problem, and I\\'m sure she could\\'ve walked faster if she wanted to.  Regardless, the service was painfully slow, for everything, and we were rarely \"checked upon\".  Hot Taco was NOT slammed that day, nor near reaching full capacity.  Their website says their looking for motivated people to hire.  I think they\\'re failing on that aspect.  \\n\\nThe only reason we went there was b/c my MIL wanted a good Margarita.  She was pleased with her drink, but commented that the food was \\'okay\\', which is her way of saying \"not good\".  I agree, the food was not good.  My wife had the Korean Beef Tacos, if I were to grade on presentation, it would\\'ve been a 3/10.  Taste 5/10.  The paltry amount of beans and rice they give you is sad, as was the taste of it.  My father in law had the fish tacos.  This is a man known for eating anything, at anytime, anywhere, regardless of when his last meal was.  He didn\\'t finish the tacos, nor the beans and rice.  \\n\\nThe guacamole came out in a big glob on a big plate with two tortilla chips stuck into it (my MIL did verify it was fresh, but it needed more salt and lime juice)...  The queso con chorizo was terrible.  The tortilla chips they serve, sub-par.  The Queso con chorizo comes in this little skillet that sits atop a little holder that has a little candle underneath it to keep it from congealing.  The candle is worthless, and it thickened rather quickly.  The fried jalapenos weren\\'t that great either.  There was actually one left at the end of the night if that says anything.  Erin talked us into the \"fried cheese cake\" - it wasn\\'t that good either, and it was fried!!  What fried food isn\\'t good?  Hot Taco\\'s fried food apparently.      \\n\\nI guess they also have a small selection for the music they play.  For first 3/4 of our time there, all we heard was Reggaeton?!  I guess that\\'s part of the \"hip\" vibe they\\'re going for? \"Um, how about some Vicente Fernandez, or Ana Gabriel?\".  Once the Reggaeton playlist played out, then came some Merengue and other upbeat Hispanic club classics.  My wife and her friends commented on how they heard the same songs the last time.  \\n\\nFor the prices they\\'re asking, you\\'re better off going to a \\'Real Mexican\\' restaurant - if you want real Mexican food (This food is the Americanized version of Mexican, seriously).  If you want to appear trendy and say you ate uptown, and you like bad service and sub-par food, then eat here.  \\n\\nI rarely tip less than 20%, but on this day, our bill came to $147.xx, and I tipped just under 15% (if I had the heart, I would\\'ve tipped less)...  Again, the service was slow and simply unpleasant, the food was not good, and when our meals came out, they came out in pairs, not altogether, in 3-4 minute intervals...  Bottom line, if you want a good drink, I \\'guess\\' you could go here, but if you want real Mexican food look elsewhere.\\n\\nThe only thing good I can say about my first and last visit to Hot Taco is that the decor was pretty cool, inside and out, but you can\\'t eat the decor...',\n",

The bulge was still there and she kept saying \" I don\\'t know what to tell you\" \" I don\\'t know how to fix it\" Its because you gained weight\" etc etc. She should have just said she screwed up and just given me my dress instead of me going back and forth and her not even doing anything to the dress. She wouldn\\'t even discount the price besides $50 bucks from the pressing. How are you still going to charge someone $600 dollars for an unfinished botched job on her wedding dress? \\n\\nEventually I picked up my dress this week took it to my friends mother in law seamstress out of desperation and within 2 HOURS she found out what the problem was. She took my dress apart and noticed that she had tried to cover up a rip she had made on my dress by patching it with another extra lace fabric she had. Instead of sewing in the dress straight to try to fix the issue she just covered it up. So when she sewed the lace into the dress she sewed in the under layer of the dress causing it to bulge and look deformed. \\n\\nI would not recommend going here at all I don\\'t know how she has such good reviews if she treats her customers like this let alone future brides. \\n\\nThank God I was able to find a miracle seamstress who was actually able to fix the problem that she had created just days before my wedding.',\n",

Growing up in Texas and having owned and run 3 small restaurants of my own, I am admittedly a tough grader.\\n\\nCarne Asada taco combo is five stars ($7.49), served with fresh white corn soft tortillas, nice homemade ranch beans and tasty rice.  Outstanding!  Tasty!  The barbacoa was tender with good seasonings but a little salty for my taste, so it gets 3 stars.  I prefer to add salt at the table, not the kitchen.\\n\\nThe $6.25 appetizer of \"guacamole\" knocked our lights out!!  The avocados were complemented with a sprinkle of fresh cilantro and a dollop of pico de gallo.  Perfect!  With most restaurants, that is all you would get.  Not here.  A second small bowl included has a medium heat green tomatillo salsa.  Nice flavor to open and a pleasant warmth sneaks up on you to finish. The third bowl included with our \"order of guacamole\" was the real sleeper...these are green chiles like the Hatch peppers we get in Colorado.  Roasted over a smoky wood fire to infuse a marvelous richness to the chile-generous portion.  Again, not too picante, you can add heat with a tabletop hot sauce.  Too many places use heat to cover up lack of skill in the kitchen.\\n\\nThis is real family cooking.  Our waitress Carla, the owner Celina and her son Marcos all work together in the kitchen and the personal touch is reflected in the flavors on the table.  Because it is family run, they close on Sunday so we were not able to return for the fish and shrimp tacos.\\n\\nWe washed it down with cold and sweet homemade Horchata, redolent with cinnamon and very refreshing.\\n\\nFull and happy, we could not leave without sampling the ice cream in the front case.  Our table enjoyed rich, creamy ice cream sundaes covered with mango or strawberries.\\n\\nIn Texas, the \"hole in the wall\" is what we all look for and share with our friends.

The owner came over and spent time with us and educated us on the different wines.  I am not much of a wine drinker, but he listened to what I like and made a perfect recommendation, and to my surprise I loved it!  My husband who likes fine wines was in wine heaven here.  We ordered the scallops and the salmon, and I have to say they were done to perfection and sooo very good.  We also had their charcuterie board that had some cheese and meats I was not familier with but they were excellent.  We split a chocolate chip, banana bread pudding with caramel sauce that was out of this world.

That\\'s great for her, not so great for me who was kept waiting during her spontaneous therapy session. \\n  After we got underway, the assistant, Serenity took a metallic instrument to the inside of my mouth (I think it was a laser) and did so with all the delicacy of a bull in a china shop. I lost count how many times she banged me in my teeth with it (which may seem like nothing from the outside but when it\\'s the inside of your mouth it felt like she was using a socket wrench in there. I wanted to tell her, \"Slow down, it\\'s the inside of my mouth!\") She even missed my mouth one one try and banged me straight on in my glasses sending my head backwards. \\nWhile I was waiting for my bridge to be 3D printed, the staff were gathered in their meeting area and I think they were watching funny videos on the internet or something and the office suddenly became really loud like a high school lunch room. It was so loud I had to turn up the volume to hear the tv they provide (that was only inches from me). I\\'m no Debbie Downer but it seemed unbecoming of a place of business, not to mention a medical office.\\nNext came another assistant, Andrea, to fit my mouth with the bridge. She told me it would take 20 minutes to print and cool down. An HOUR LATER they came in still cooling it off. What? I attempted to ask why the delay but I got the runaround so I dropped it.\\nThe dentist came back in and it had taken so long that he wanted to numb my mouth again. Are you serious? I\\'ve been here so long waiting that the four needles I already had had in my mouth earlier in the the beginning have worn off?? I refused and just powered through the pain of putting in the bridgework.\\n   While installing my bridgework, the tv was still on with a political show on it. While literally the dentist and Serenity were inches from my face with their fingers in my mouth, they began discussing the politics that was being shown on the tv. Are you kidding me?\\n   I was there for a little over three and half hours. This seems a bit excessive to me. I don\\'t feel like the attention and care I was given was of high level of professionalism nor was it commensurate to the thousands of dollars I had paid for the service.\\nI had good experiences with this office in the past but I am so disappointed in my experience there today that I\\'m pretty sure I would like to try someplace else that respects your time and the thousands of dollars worth of business I gave them.

       " \"What do you get when take a diner, a romantic lounge and circa 70s/80s Vegas and mix it all together in a blender? The Peppermill of course!\\n\\nThis is a place that serves as a fond memory from childhood from me. I remember going with my mom or my grandparents to meet up with my aunt when she worked at the Stardust (now long gone). Many times we would come here for breakfast. The Stardust is a childhood memory that I feel was taken from me. But this place still remains.\\n\\nAs an adult, I love the Peppermill more than ever. Price-wise, it isn't the cheapest. It's pretty much an upscale version of a diner though, so that can be forgiven, especially considering how large the portions are. Last time I went, I had chicken fingers with fries. I received four chicken fingers and could only finish two of them before I was stuffed. And that was on the appetizer menu, mind you. I fondly remember the breakfast platters from when I was a kid, and while I haven't ordered one in a while, they always look like something to die for. Memo: get one of those next time. \\n\\nAnother thing I remember always being curious about as a kid was the lounge. I would stomp my feet, demanding to see it. Everyone always talked about how beautiful it was and I was never allowed to check it out. Wahh wahh wahh!!! Haha. Well, I'm legal now, and actually can spend time in there. And yes, it was worth the hype. It's intimate and quite lovely, albeit in the campiest way possible with the fake trees, gold barricades and 70s-style pink tube lighting. Alas, even without a date it's worth it to spend an hour or two in there if only for the ambiance. Don't worry, no one will look at you funny. \\n\\nThe Peppermill is quite the oddity on The Strip, a borderline mystery even. As it's immediate surroundings become increasingly desolate, not only does it continue to stand but every time you go in the place, it's still packed. You're lucky if you're even able to grab a seat at the diner. A strange happening indeed. Not that I'm one to complain. \\n\\nThe Final Verdict\\n\\nPros:\\nVegas classic.\\nRetro vibe and feel.\\nBeautiful lounge.\\nHuge portions. \\n\\nCons:\\nNot the cheapest food, but the portions make up for that.\\nNot the cheapest drinks, but the ambiance makes up for that.\\nCan feel a little bit campy, but it works.\\n\\nReturn Factor: 10/10.

I couldn\\'t find a kill switch, so the only way I could turn it off was by putting the key in the ignition and turning it to the \"on\" position.\\n\\nI stopped by this place after work, with new title and plate in hand, and asked how hard it would be to disable the alarm, for the time being at least, until I had more time to deal with the issue. He offered to secure my plate, then said, let us take a look.  Less than 5 minutes later, they were so sure they solved the problem by simply pulling the fuse, then wanted to charge me $40 for doing so.\\n\\nWhen I objected since they spent less than 5 minutes on the issue, I was then lectured on how I was paying for their knowledge and expertise, when in fact all they they did was pull a fuse and fasten a license plate, (the license plate, which I did not ask them to do, they offered). He then asked how much I thought the service was worth, which I really didn\\'t think was was worth anything, but I just slipped him a $20 just so I could be done with the deal.\\n\\nAs it turns out, just pulling the fuse did not work. I made two more stops after leaving, and the alarm went off again, but stopped on it\\'s own.  Later in the evening, after getting home, I forgot something in the truck. Once again, the alarm went off.  This time though, despite inserting the key to \"on\" position, it would not turn off until I reinserted the fuse.\\n\\nSo \"geniuses\", I suspect you need to go back to school.  For what you did, that should have been a good faith gesture, in hopes that I would bring my vehicle back for when I needed real repairs. But since you only thought you fixed the problem and tried to gouge me in the process, trust me, I will never come back to you again.\\n\\nFortunately, I found someone who actually did fix the problem, and only charged me $20 to do so!  Put this up on your wall!!',\n",

The morning of the scheduled surgery, they called and asked her to be there early as the surgeon had a cancellation. Her surgery was scheduled for 2:90 PM before the supposed cancellation that bumped her up. Her surgery actually happened at 4:15. The surgical liaison was non responsive and kept telling me not to come up until they called me. I went up at 8:30 PM to find everyone I was dealing with had gone home! I will never come back to this hospital for anything! Ridiculous lack of information with everyone telling you something different and contradictory! No one is in charge and no one knows anything! Sure hope they did the correct surgery on my cousin!',\n",
       " 'I have eaten at the Milos in New York and numerous times at this one (Vegas). It is in the Cosmopolitan and it is simply top notch. It is expensive . . . no doubt about that. I feel bad recommending it to my friends because of this . . . but there is a certain combination that is simply among the best food that I have every eaten anywhere in the world. And that is saying a lot. I have eaten at some of the best restaurants around. Ok, here is the absolutely no-risk lineup:  \\n\\nFirst, skip the table bread. It is nothing special and you do NOT want to get filled up with bread. \\n\\nSecond, order the Milos Special. Unbelievable. This easily serves 3-4 at the table. It is reminiscent of chips and dip BUT blessed by the Greek Gods. Savory fried zucchini and eggplant chisp with with tzatziki and a fried Greek cheese. You cannot stop eating it. Truly fantastic. \\n\\nThird, order the Greek Salad. Sounds fairly pedestrian. It is not. It is exquisite. I don\\'t know how else to describe it. Las Vegas weekly calls it \"simple perfection\" and I cannot disagree. I promise you that you will rave about it. My wife and I split it because we have more menu items coming. \\n\\nFourth, order the lamb. People call us crazy when we do that. Milos is, after all, known for their remarkable seafood. And we have eaten widely and happily among the seafood selection until . . . blam, we tried the lamb one day. Heaven. Since that moment, we have never ordered another main entre. And everyone I have cajoled and begged into trying it has blessed my name forever more. It is the most succulent cut of meat that you can eat. Perfectly seasoned bliss. Every bite. It is impossible to oversell the thing.  \\n\\nFinally, if you have sat for awhile and have some room for dessert: I recommend \"The Real Greek Yogurt\" selection. It is not for everyone. It is a wonderful heavy and tart Greek Yogurt offset with honey and walnuts. The contrasting flavors is delicious to me. But not everyone is overcome like I am with it. And, honestly, none of the desserts on the same scale as the three items I recommend above. \\n\\nIn summary, I swear to you that if you order: (1) Milos Special; (2) Greek Salad and (3) Lamb, you will have one of the best dinners you have ever had in your life. I have made that same boast to several friends and family members when we have gone there and when the dust cleared, they all agreed with me. It is something to rave about.',\n",
       " 'I purchased an over-the-counter (OTC) drug, called Extrastrength Tylenol Nighttime from the Rexall pharmacy located at 595 Bay Street, Toronto, ON on January 24, 2015. It turns out that the drug had an expiration date of 7/2014. As the pharmacy SHOULD know, once the expiration date has passed there is no assurance that the drug has the safety, identity, strength, quality and purity characteristics it purports or represents to possess. As such, Health Canada considers the sale of expired drugs to be the sale of unlicensed drugs. According to the Drug and Pharmacies Regulation Act: ONTARIO REGULATION 58/11 s. 24 (6), \"The pharmacy MUST have and maintain a program to ensure, the safe and appropriate disposal of waste and expired consumables, including drugs and other medications\". Failing to remove a drug or natural health product from pharmacy stock beyond its expiry date is considered an Act of proprietary misconduct [O. Reg. 58/11, s. 50(8)].  Not only is this pharmacy in violation to the regulation, it is also putting consumers at risk: the website, askyourpharmacist.ca, hosted by a team of Ontario pharmacists, says that in some cases, a drug\\'s composition could change over time, making it potentially hazardous. Due to the gravity of this incident I am posting a review on Yelp so that consumers can exercise caution and check the expiration dates before buying from Rexall because sadly some of their retailers are not conscientious and responsible as they should be.',\n",

We were then brought our appetizer about 30 minutes later and weren't given any plates or napkins with that. My husband had to get up and go look for plates so that we could enjoy our chicken wings after being there an hour and 15 minutes. Meanwhile our waitress still hadn't taken our order. 2 hours later we were provided our dinner of of prime rib, filet, shrimp, & ribs. Never once was there an apology for the service or lack thereof. We requested our bill and our food upon delivery at our table. Needless to say, are $100 to go dinner was not what we look for when going out.
